# Introduction 

I began this module thinking about data manipulation in a way which was purely research based, not thinking about how various technologies can influence our interpretation of this data. Archaeology is something that most people would consider interesting, yet prior to the last few decades, we had very few ways of spreading archaeological information in ways which weren't based on research or films. Week 11 was the most entertaining one in my opinion, since it dealt with the modern incorporation of digital archaeology in videogames and creative projects.


## Fail

The main fail for this module is that I was unable to complete the work for this week due to a lack of time. Though, i was able to complete the readings and learned a lot about the social implications or archaeology, such as the power of social media, to things like archiving indigenous data. I think the main thing that I wasn't able to do was connect that information to any of the excercises. While I worked in R in the previous module, and I've built many static websites in the past, I simply did not connect this new information to those technologies. 


## Win

One main win I had for this module was that I had previously worked with many of the technologies involved in this module. I have experience working with static websites, so I was able to understand most of the process involved, granted I've never created a static site through Github before. Another part was the Digital Creativity and Archaeogaming portions, which I have done very similar projects in the past involving these, the only difference being that I wasn't using archaeology as a main focus.

## Challenges

I think because of the main problem being that I didn't have the time to complete the assigned work for this module, it made writing this consolidation document rather difficult, since I didn't have as much to write about in comparison to the previous modules. I'm mostly writing this document as a response to the readings,  since the readings are composed of many different topics relating to digital archaeology, and aspects about them can be somewhat generalized.

## Implications?

I think with Digital Archaeology, there is a certain amount of work that needs to be done to ensure that representations of information, no matter how creative, need to be as accurate as possible. Recording data and processing it can have errors, and so it's necessary to understand data from different points of view in order to properly use it in another medium. Things like photo essays, games and websites might have archaeological information, but the accuracy of that information entirely depends on the collection process that we saw in module one, and the data analysis process which we saw in module two and the beginning of module three.

## Previous Feedback

Similar to my last consolidation document, I mostly wrote this document based on feedback from the first module and from the email sent to the class. For this module, my experience with is was almost entirely based on the reading so there wasn't really any way for me to properly compare them to the assignments, but I did my best by reading through the assignments and understanding them the best I could.

## Changes I'm making moving forward

Since this is the last consolidation document, there aren't any more changes I can really do in terms of moving forward in this class. Although, I think that many of the technologies I was exposed to will help me in future studies and potentially across many different fields. I hope that one day I will work in archaeology, but no one really knows what the future holds, and life might hold something else for me entirely. Archaeology is a way of exploring the material past, yet the information which is collected, manipulated, stored, and researched, was all current information at one time. There's a lot happening in this current moment that we might see as insignificant yet in the future, might be invaluable for future archaeologists. I aknowledge that any changes I will make with this last module won't be as significant as the changes made by other students in the class since my exposure to the material was not the same. And so when we look back at the very first question, of "What is digital archaeology?", I suppose the answer is that digital archaeology can have very different results for everyone, and they all depend on the person's past experiences and perspective.
